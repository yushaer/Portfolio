## Getting Started




The basics of creating a menu in your script is as follows.
```javascript
import {Menu,MenuOption} from "./menu_system/menu"
//new Menu(name,options,width,posx,posy,menucolor)
//Initalizes the menu
let menu = new Menu("Simple Menu",["option1"], 150, -100, 0,[100, 200, 248,Math.round( 255)]);
//keycode for f4 key
const f4_key=115;
//game loop
while(true){
    wait(0);
    //menu toggle on press of f4 key
    if (Pad.IsKeyPressed(f4_key)) {
      while (Pad.IsKeyPressed(f4_key)) {
        wait(0);
      }
  
      menu.setActive(!menu.isActive());
    }
    //if the menu is active, it draws the menu to screen
    if(menu.isActive()){
        menu.draw();
    }
}
```
